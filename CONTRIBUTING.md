# Contribution Guidelines for sdf

### Project scope
The purpose of this project is to provide an easy way to interact with 3D and 2D models using the flexible aspect of signed distance functions. 

Code should favor readability and explicitness over cleverness. This makes code easy to review and verify, not only at submission, but also for users who want to understand how the algorithms work. Where possible, the source of algorithms should be referenced in the comments.
